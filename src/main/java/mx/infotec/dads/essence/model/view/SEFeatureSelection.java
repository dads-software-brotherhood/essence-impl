/**

 * <b>Description: </b>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The Class FeatureSelection. A reference to a construct feature such as a
 * particular attribute or association.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * <b>Invariant:</b>
 * 
 * {@code
 * true
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * <b>Semantics:</b>
 * 
 * A feature selection names a feature (property or association) from a language construct which is to be included in a view.
 * The feature is identified by its name, since property and association names are unique within a language element. If a
 * feature with the given name does not exist, this feature selection does not contribute anything to the view.
 *
